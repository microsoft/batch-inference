# Batch Inference Toolkit

Batch Inference Toolkit(batch-inference) is a Python package that batches model input tensors coming from multiple users dynamically, executes the model, un-batches output tensors and then returns them back to each user respectively. This will improve system throughput because of a better cache locality. The entire process is transparent to developers.

## Installation

**Install from Pip** _(Coming Soon)_

```bash
python -m pip install batch-inference --upgrade
```

**Build and Install from Source** _(for developers)_

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/batch-inference.git
python -m pip install -e .[docs,testing]

# if you want to format the code before commit
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# run unittests
python -m unittest discover tests
```

## Example

```python
import threading
import numpy as np
from batch_inference import batching


@batching(max_batch_size=32)
class MyModel:
    def __init__(self, k, n):
        self.weights = np.random.randn((k, n)).astype("f")

    # x: [batch_size, m, k], self.weights: [k, n]
    def predict_batch(self, x):
        y = np.matmul(x, self.weights)
        return y


with MyModel.host(3, 3) as host:
    def send_requests():
        for _ in range(0, 10):
            x = np.random.randn(1, 3, 3).astype("f")
            y = host.predict(x)

    threads = [threading.Thread(target=send_requests) for i in range(0, 32)]
    [th.start() for th in threads]
    [th.join() for th in threads]

```

## Build the Docs

Run the following commands and open `docs/_build/html/index.html` in browser.

```bash
pip install sphinx myst-parser sphinx-rtd-theme sphinxemoji
cd docs/

make html         # for linux
.\make.bat html   # for windows
```
